📌 Project Overview
The Sustainable Supplier Selection Tool is an dashboard solution that helps procurement managers identify, evaluate, and compare suppliers based on sustainability metrics. As organizations face increasing pressure to source eco-friendly suppliers at scale, this tool provides a structured and data-driven approach to supplier selection.

🔍 Use Case Description
Organizations struggle with finding sustainable suppliers, managing diverse certifications, and comparing environmental impacts across industries. This tool leverages sustainability data to support procurement teams in making better sourcing decisions.

The solution enables:
Filtering suppliers by certifications (ISO 14001, Fair Trade, Organic, B Corp, Rainforest Alliance).
Evaluating suppliers across quantitative factors (emissions, carbon footprint, recycling rate, energy efficiency) and qualitative factors (sustainability policies).
Ranking suppliers with clear scoring logic for transparency.
Simulating what-if scenarios, such as switching suppliers, to understand environmental impacts.

🎯 Objectives & Outcomes
Provide a supplier sustainability dashboard to track metrics such as carbon footprint, recycling rate, and energy efficiency.
Offer ranked supplier lists for decision-making.
Reduce environmental risks in sourcing by ensuring compliance with sustainability certifications.
